attempt 1-
Correct orientiation but NOPE on height:
Orientation order = S N W E SW ?SE? NW ?NE? (in this order then copy 3x which goes to row 27744... then replace all "001" with "000" <- transparent color)

attempt 2 - (worked but squished...)
Orientation order = S -> N -> W -> E -> SW -> ?SE? -> NW -> ?NE? (34x102 image and in the listed order, should go to 27744... then replace all "001" with "000" <- transparent color)
